Project as part of a course which allows you to sign in/register and then paste a link to an image which is then displayed and any faces in the images are detected (via a facial recognition api) and boxes displayed around them.  This project is intended to show use of React, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Databases (PostgreSQL) and APIs (back end in separate repository).  This project is not live yet, code is currently just kept here.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
